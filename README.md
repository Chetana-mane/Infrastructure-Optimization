# EV Infrastructure Optimization Project

## Objective and Strategic Direction

**Objective**: Transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on strategies to establish sustainable and accessible EV infrastructure.

**Strategic Decisions**:
- Infrastructure development
- Policy incentives
- Market trends
- Social impact
- Technology adoption
- Stakeholder engagement

---

## Operational Research and AI/ML Integration

- **Key Techniques**: Genetic algorithms, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and simulated annealing were utilized to determine optimal EV charging station locations.
- **AI/ML Applications**: Leveraged AI/ML to enhance OR models, focusing on battery management, strategic planning, energy optimization, and supporting policy-making.

---

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Data Sources**: Collected geographic data on petrol stations in Southampton, UK, using coordinates from Google Maps, and validated via multiple mapping tools.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and standardized data, converted postcodes for calculations, and generated distance matrices for analysis.

## Distance Matrix Calculations

- **Euclidean Distance Matrix**: Used to analyze spatial proximity patterns.

## Clustering Analysis

- **Cluster Visualization**: Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for clustering, identifying high-density (potential closure) and low-density (critical coverage) zones.

## Facility Location Optimization Model

- **Objective**: Created a model to close 60% of petrol stations while maintaining maximum coverage for ICE vehicles.
- **Model Constraints**: Geographic proximity, minimum station count, and specific station closures were considered to maximize area coverage.
